# Project 3 Proposal

### Project owner:

+ Nelson Wang


### Topic: Fine tune a pre-trained CNN and use it to classify flowers

+ Compare 10 pre-trained Keras CNN models on their effectiveness in reading pictures and classifying flower types
+ Pick the best pre-trained model and fine tune it, in the hope of improving its prediction accuracy and reduction in loss.

### Dataset

+ Scrapped pictures from ImageNet website for training and validation
+ Downloaded flower picture dataset from Kaggle for testing

### Additional thougths:

+ If time allows, use Flask to serve a simple website where users can upload flower pictures and get flower name from the fine tuned model.  The website will also use the returned name to open wiki page with description of the flower, and open google image page with the flower selected.
