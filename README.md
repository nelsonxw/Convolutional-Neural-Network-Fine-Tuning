# CNN Model Fine Tuning and Flower Classifications

### Problem Statement:  
What is an effective way to satify the curiosity of a five-year old kid?  When walking in a beautiful botanical garden with blooming flowers, how to utilize machine learning to help a human being learn the names of different flowers?

### Objective:

+ Compare 10 pre-trained Keras CNN models on their effectiveness in classifying flower types.
+ Pick the best pre-trained model and fine tune it to improve its prediction accuracy and achieve higher reductions in loss.
+ Create a simple web app where uses can upload pictures and find out the name of flowers

### Dataset:

+ Scrapped pictures from ImageNet website for training and validation
+ Downloaded flower picture dataset from Kaggle for testing
