# CNN Model Fine Tuning and Flower Classifications

### Objective:

+ Compare 10 pre-trained Keras CNN models on their effectiveness in classifying flower types.
+ Pick the best pre-trained model and fine tune it, in the hope of improving its prediction accuracy and reduction in loss.
+ Create a simple website where uses can upload pictures and find out the name of flowers

### Dataset

+ Scrapped pictures from ImageNet website for training and validation
+ Downloaded flower picture dataset from Kaggle for testing
